This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' big asteroids images had been resized with an external software editor called "Free Image Convert And Resize" contained 
inside a multiapplication editor and up/downloader software called "DVDVideoSoft Free Studio in its version 6.6.1.119 to a ressolution 
in pixels of 96X96 because i found it big enough in relation to the ship size and also de screen size that they circulate. 
Another solution would be to modify the values of line 57 in order to adjust the different mechanics of this element of our videogame.

2.- Here I'll put a variety of different big asteroid images extracted through all the internet with no copyright infringement intended 
and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the type of explosion of the game going to line 18 of
the javascript file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous asteroid just by typing "asteroidLargeX.png" (X goes from none to 6).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
