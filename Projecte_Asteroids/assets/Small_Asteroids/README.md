This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' small asteroid images have been resized with an external software editor called "Free Image Convert And Resize" 
contained inside a multiapplication editor and up/downloader software called "DVDVideoSoft Free Studio in its version 6.6.1.119 to a 
ressolution in pixels of 32X32 because matches with the ship size and also in the screen size looks clearly when they flow. 
Another solution would be to modify the values of line 59 in order to adjust the different mechanics of this element of our videogame.

2.- Here I'll put a variety of different medium asteroid images extracted through all the internet with no copyright infringement 
intended and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the type of asteroid going to line 20 of the 
javascript file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous one just by typing "asteroidSmallX.png" (X goes from none to 6).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
