This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' bullet images had been resized with an external software editor called "Paint" brought by default in
Windows Operating System to a ressolution in pixels of 15x7 because i found in proportion suitable to be contained in an hipothetical
canyon of the ship and also to the proportions of the ship.

2.- Also the orientation of the photos of the bullets are changed respect the default position in order to match in the game with the
rotation of the ship.

3.- Here I'll put a variety of different bullet images (in Laser Form or in Rocket Form) extracted through all the internet with no 
copyright infringement intended and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the type of bullet 
that will prefer to use going to line 16 of my main game configuration file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous one 
just typing "bulletX.png" (X goes from none to 10).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
