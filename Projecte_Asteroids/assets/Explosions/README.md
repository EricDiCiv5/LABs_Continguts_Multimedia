This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' and '.JPG' background images had been resized with an external software editor called "Free Image Convert And Resize" 
contained inside a multiapplication editor and up/downloader software called "DVDVideoSoft Free Studio in its version 6.6.1.119 
to a ressolutions in pixels of twiceXfour times size asteroid pixels in order to create the effect that the explosion caused is bigger than the object that remains surrounded in it and also because this files represents all the procedure of an explosion by 
collision of a bullet to the different sizes of asteroids. Another solution would be to modify the values of lines 23,24 and 25 of my file "EDC_game.js" after look the ressolution of the image by clicking right and go to "Properties" and then "Details" in order to adjust properly the PNG or JPG to the background of the game.

2.- Here I'll put a variety of different explosion images extracted through all the internet with no copyright infringement intended 
and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the type of explosion of the game going to lines 
22,24 and 25 of the javascript file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous explosion just by typing "explosion[Large/Medium/Small]X.png"
or "explosion[Large/Medium/Small]X.jpg" (X goes from none to 5).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
