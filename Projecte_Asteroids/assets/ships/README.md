This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' ship images have been resized with an external software editor called "Paint" brought by default in Windows Operating 
System to a ressolution of 64x64 because i found in proportion suitable to defeat all the asteroids and be able to avoid them by running 
from all over the map.

2.- Also the orientation of the photos of the ships have been changed respect the default position in order to match in the game with the
rotation of the bullet (which can be changed in the line 334 of the code "EDC_game.js" by typing a number between 0 and 360).

3.- Here I'll put a variety of different ship images (more realitstic mor mre in cartoon essence) extracted through all the internet with 
no copyright infringement intended and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the type of bullet that
will prefer to use going to line 16 of my main game configuration file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous one just typing
"shipX.png" (X goes from none to 10).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
