This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.M4A' and '.OGG' audio files have been extracted from a '.zip' file posted in a website path called 
"http://opengameart.org/content/100-plus-game-sound-effects-wavoggm4a" in order to have a variety of retro videogame inspired sounds made
with synth effects for enrich the environment of the game through a different human sense respect the view. 

2.- Also this sounds that i'll upload doesn't have any copyright infringement intended and also have any intention of commercial purposes,
giving the possibility for the user to change the type of sounds for the firing action and the collision event going to lines 29 and 30
of my main game configuration file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous one just typing "fireX.[m4a/ogg]" or "destroyedX.[m4a/ogg]".
(X goes from none to 11).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
