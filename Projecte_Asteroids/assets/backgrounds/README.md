This file pretends to be a quick guide for those who had acessed to this subfolder:

1.- All my '.PNG' and '.JPG' background images have been resized with an external software editor called "Free Image Convert And Resize" 
contained inside a multiapplication editor and up/downloader software called "DVDVideoSoft Free Studio in its version 6.6.1.119 to a 
ressolution in pixels of 1024x768 because i found it big enough and compatible for most current computer monitors in the market. 
Another solution would be to modify the values of lines 2 and 3 of my file "EDC_game.js" after look the ressolution of the image by 
clicking right and go to "Properties" and then "Details" in order to adjust properly the PNG or JPG to the background of the game.

2.- Here I'll put a variety of different outer space images (Realistic or Fictional) extracted through all the internet with no copyright infringement intended and also not commercial purposes, giving the possibility for the user to change the landscape of the game going to line 22 of the javascript file "EDC_game.js" and overwrite the previous one just typing "backgroundX.png" or "backgroundX.jpg" (X goes from none to 20).

Greetings and have fun, EDC!
